Personally, I&apos;m a software and science\n            loving gamer geek. I&apos;m into maths, physics, game design, tech,\n            and am currently playing an unhealthy amount of &ldquo;Hollow\n            Knight&rdquo; and &ldquo;Legends of Runeterra&rdquo;. I obtained an\n            MSc in Physics with the goal of becoming an academic before making\n            the decision to switch to industry. Professionally, I&apos;m a full\n            stack engineer and data scientist at{\" \"}\n            <A href=\"https://kandua.com\">Kandua</A>. I am also learning the\n            ropes in product management. In my day to day I use tools like\n            React, Express, GCP, PostgreSQL, and Python to build{\" \"}\n            <A href=\"https://kandua.com\">Kandua</A> and gain insights into what\n            its customer base is doing on the platform. Previously, I was a data\n            science tutor at{\" \"}\n            <A href=\"https://explore-datascience.net/\">Explore</A> and a\n            consultant at <A href=\"https://percept.co.za\">Percept</A>.\n          </p>\n          <h1>This blog</h1>\n          <p>\n            I built this blog as a means of sharing what I have learnt about\n            data science, tech, stats, and anything else I enjoy really. I built\n            and designed it from scratch using React, styled-components,\n            Webpack, and other tools (largely to teach myself how to build a\n            blog from scratch).
